		default error handler is not called.
	
v0.1.0 (11 Aug 2013)
	The code has been refactored. As soon as a task is executed it is removed from
		the queue, therefore, "stop()" and "restart()" are no longer needed.
		The queue doesn't remember the sequence of tasks, like Express does, because
		this is not the objective of this module.
	Removed "stop()" and "restart()".
	Added "unshift()".
